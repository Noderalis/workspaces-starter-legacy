# Y2WT Services

In order to push the limits and be more than a simple starter, I'm using a sort of microservice architecture that you can delete if you want. This also powers some of my upcoming software at [Blackfall Labs](https://blackfall-labs.com). 

The services are simple Express servers, you can read more about Node.js Microservices by reading this [beginner tutorial ](https://medium.com/@cramirez92/build-a-nodejs-cinema-microservice-and-deploying-it-with-docker-part-1-7e28e25bfa8b) which explains everything beautifully!

I plan to reimplement everything using a GraphQL Microservices architecture, and pull the frontend over to using Apollo at some point.
